music player daemon
===================
this repository contains mpd version 0.21.10 source code, which does not hang
on my machines unlike any version that released after it, with include's added
to allow it to build with gcc and clang 10.

upstream repository is located at https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD. do
keep in mind that they're not very friendly to dumb nodevs like me.
